.SH DESCRIPTION

daVinci replicates a 'shell' or command line interpreter, which is a user\
interface used for access to an operating system's services.  This shell has\
a set of custom built-in commands, and also integrates with other commands\
located in the system's PATH.



.SH OPTIONS
.IP -b
Do not write `busy' to stdout while processing.
.IP "-c config-file"
Use the alternate system wide
.I config-file
instead of
.IR /etc/foo.conf .
This overrides any
.B FOOCONF
environment variable.
.IP -a
In addition to the baz segments, also parse the
blurfl headers.
.IP -r
Recursive mode. Operates as fast as lightning
at the expense of a megabyte of virtual memory.



.SH ENVIRONMENT

.IP FOOCONF
If non-null the full pathname for an alternate system wide
.IR foo.conf .
Overridden by the
.B -c
option.

.SH DESCRIPTION

daVinci replicates a 'shell' or command line interpreter, which is a user\
interface program for access to an operating system's services.  This shell has\
a set of custom built-in commands, and also integrates with other commands\
located in the system's PATH.  The output is designed to exactly or as close\
as possible replicate the shell 'sh' or 'dash' ($ man dash).  daVinci takes\
commands from files, shell scripts or user input in either an interactive or\
non-interactive mode (explained in INVOCATION section).




.SH INVOCATION

to initialize daVinci, you must compile all the included files using gcc.\
Then run the output file, with a command such as this: $ ./a.out.  daVinci is\
designed to be compiled like with this command:

gcc -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic *.c -o hsh

if daVinci is exectured, it will initialize in what is considered 'interactive\
mode.'  In this scenario, the user is prompted for a command and then the\
command is executed after the newline or 'enter' is input.  daVinci can also\
function in non-interactive mode by using shell scripts, such as a '|' before
the daVinci executable file ('hsh').  This is an example:

echo 'ls' | ./hsh

Commands may also be input into daVinci through a file containing commands:

cat aFile | ./hsh




.SH OPTIONS

daVinci does not take any options but does utilize the variable extern char\
**environ.  This is currently part of the future goals of daVinci
